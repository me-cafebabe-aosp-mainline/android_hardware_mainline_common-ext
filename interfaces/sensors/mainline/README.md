# Mainline Sensors HAL

A generic Android Sensors HAL (`android.hardware.sensors`, AIDL version 3) for
devices running a mainline Linux kernel. Sensors are consumed through the
standard Linux interfaces (IIO, input) so that the HAL works on as many devices
as possible without device specific configuration, while still allowing
everything to be tuned through configuration files and properties.

* HAL name: `mainline_ext`
* Service: `vendor.sensors-mainline`
  (`/apex/com.android.hardware.sensors/bin/hw/android.hardware.sensors-service.mainline_ext`)
* APEX module: `com.android.hardware.sensors.mainline_ext`
* AIDL instance: `android.hardware.sensors.ISensors/default`

```

* The **frontend** (this directory) implements the AIDL interface, loads the
  backends with `dlopen()`, merges their sensors into one list with global
  handles, routes requests, feeds composite sensors and writes events to the
  framework's fast message queue. It has no knowledge of specific backends.
* A **backend** (`backends/<name>/`, `libsensors_<name>.so`) bridges one
  subsystem to the [`ISensorBackend`](include/libsensors_mainline/SensorBackend.h)
  interface. Several backends contribute to the sensor list at the same time.
* **Composite sensors** (`composite/`) are virtual sensors computed in the
  frontend from hardware sensor events (currently `DEVICE_ORIENTATION` from the
  accelerometer). They are only registered when no backend provides the type.
* **Utility libraries** (`utils/`) are static libraries shared by frontend and
  backends: `libsensors_common` (sysfs, settings, mount matrix, events, sensor
  type traits, periodic worker) and `libsensors_hwdb` (systemd sensor hwdb).

| Backend | Library                  | Source                                  | Documentation                        |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| IIO     | `libsensors_ext_iio.so`  | Linux IIO subsystem (`drivers/iio/`)     | [backends/iio/README.md](backends/iio/README.md) |
| Input   | `libsensors_ext_input.so`| Linux input subsystem (`drivers/input/misc/`) | [backends/input/README.md](backends/input/README.md) |
| Mock    | `libsensors_ext_mock.so` | Fake data, fallback only                 | [backends/mock/README.md](backends/mock/README.md) |

Backends are loaded in the order `iio, input, mock` by default. The mock
backend is *fallback only*: its sensors are dropped for every type a real
backend already provides.

Out-of-tree backends (for example `libsensors_ext_libssc` for Qualcomm Sensor
Core sensors, see `hardware/mainline/qcom-ext/libraries/libsensors_libssc/README.md`)
implement the same interface, may link `libsensors_ext_common` statically, are built against
`//hardware/mainline/common-ext:libsensors_mainline_ext_headers` and can either be
bundled into the APEX (`include_custom_backends`) or installed in
`/vendor/lib{,64}{/hw,}`; the APEX linker configuration permits loading from
`/odm` and `/vendor`.

## Building

```makefile
TARGET_SENSORS_HAL := mainline_ext
PRODUCT_PACKAGES += com.android.hardware.sensors.mainline_ext
```

Soong config variables (namespace `sensors_hal_mainline`):

| Variable                       | Type        | Purpose                                                        |
|--------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `load_custom_backends`         | string      | Default backend list, e.g. `libssc,iio,input,mock`             |
| `include_custom_backends`      | string list | Extra backend modules bundled in the APEX                      |
| `run_as_root`                  | bool        | Run the service as root (development only)                     |
| `include_all_permission_xmls`  | bool        | Ship the `android.hardware.sensor.*` feature XMLs              |

Example (`device/mainline/qcom-common/optional/sensors-hal_mainline/product.mk`):

```makefile
$(call soong_config_set_string_list,sensors_hal_mainline,include_custom_backends,//hardware/mainline/qcom:libsensors_libssc)
$(call soong_config_set,sensors_hal_mainline,load_custom_backends,libssc$(comma)iio)
```

## Configuration

The HAL is designed to need no configuration. When something cannot be
determined at runtime (accelerometer orientation of a board without
`mount-matrix`, proximity threshold, scale of a legacy input driver, ...) it
can be provided through **settings**. A setting is a dotted key such as
`iio.bmi160.mount_matrix` and is looked up as:

1. Android property `vendor.sensors.<key>` (highest priority; `setprop` for
   quick experiments),
2. configuration files `/odm/etc/sensors/*.conf` (overrides `/vendor`),
3. configuration files `/vendor/etc/sensors/*.conf`.

Configuration file format:

```ini
# /vendor/etc/sensors/sensors.conf
backends = iio,input

[iio.bmi160]
mount_matrix = 0, -1, 0; -1, 0, 0; 0, 0, 1
power = 0.18

[iio.stk3310]
proximity_near_level = 800

[input.bma150]
lsb_per_g = 256
```

Names used in keys are sanitized: every character outside `[A-Za-z0-9_]`
becomes `_` (`qcom-smgr-accel` → `qcom_smgr_accel`, `ADXL34x accelerometer` →
`ADXL34x_accelerometer`).

### Frontend settings

| Key                                     | Default          | Meaning                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `backends`                              | build default or `iio,input,mock` | Comma separated backend list (short names, library names or paths) |
| `wait_for_sensors`                      | `0`              | Number of hardware sensors to wait for at start-up (0 disables the wait) |
| `wait_for_sensors_timeout_ms`           | `10000`          | How long to wait for them before giving up                 |
| `wait_for_sensors_interval_ms`          | `500`            | Delay between two discovery attempts                       |
| `composite.device_orientation.enabled`  | `false`          | Register the composite `DEVICE_ORIENTATION` sensor         |
| `composite.device_orientation.invert_x` / `invert_y` / `invert_z` | `false` | Device orientation workaround: negate an axis              |
| `composite.device_orientation.rotation_offset` | `0`       | Device orientation workaround: add 90/180/270 degrees      |
| `composite.device_orientation.swap_xy`  | `false`          | Device orientation workaround: swap X and Y                |
| `debug.log_events`                      | `false`          | Log every event at INFO level                              |

The orientation workarounds are read each time the composite sensor is
activated, so they can be tuned live:

```
setprop vendor.sensors.composite.device_orientation.rotation_offset 180
```

### Waiting for late sensors

The framework reads the sensor list once, shortly after boot, and a sensor
missing from it stays missing until the framework restarts. Sensors can however
show up late: IIO devices probe asynchronously (regulators, deferred probe) and
the Qualcomm sensor DSP only answers once its firmware and the QMI plumbing are
up.

Set `wait_for_sensors` to the number of hardware sensors the device is expected
to expose (composite sensors are not counted). Discovery is then repeated every
`wait_for_sensors_interval_ms` until that many sensors are found or
`wait_for_sensors_timeout_ms` has elapsed, and only then is the HAL service
registered. Each attempt starts from scratch, so handles are the same as they
would be without the wait, and a timeout is logged as a warning and leaves the
HAL running with whatever was found.

```ini
# Global settings, i.e. before any [section] line
wait_for_sensors = 5
wait_for_sensors_timeout_ms = 15000
```

or, for a quick test on the device (before the framework starts):

```
setprop vendor.sensors.wait_for_sensors 5
```

Count the sensors of a working boot with `dumpsys sensorservice` or from the
`Exposed sensor:` lines of the HAL log. Keep the timeout below the point where
waiting for the sensor service becomes worse than missing a sensor; the wait
delays the registration of the HAL service.

The backends additionally have their own knobs for the same problem
(`iio.discovery_wait_ms`, `ssc.discovery_wait_ms`), which wait *inside* one
discovery pass instead of repeating it.

Backend specific keys are documented in the backend READMEs.

### Sensor hardware database

The IIO and input backends use the systemd compatible sensor hwdb
(`60-sensor.hwdb`, maintained by the Linux community) to obtain
`ACCEL_MOUNT_MATRIX` and `PROXIMITY_NEAR_LEVEL` for devices whose kernel
drivers do not provide them. Copy the file to
`/vendor/etc/sensors/hwdb.d/60-sensor.hwdb` (the legacy
`/vendor/etc/hwdb.d/60-sensor.hwdb` location is still read). Entries are
matched with the parent device modalias and the DMI modalias (or SMBIOS
tables when the kernel does not expose it).

## Runtime behaviour

* Handles are assigned sequentially in backend load order and discovery order
  and stay stable across framework restarts (discovery happens once at
  service start).
* `initialize()` deactivates every sensor and re-creates the FMQs, as required
  by the AIDL contract.
* Events carry `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` timestamps.
* WAKE_UP events hold a wake lock (`SensorsHAL_WAKEUP_mainline`) until the
  framework acknowledges them, with the mandatory 1 s auto release.
* Data injection is supported for sensors advertising the
  `DATA_INJECTION` flag (the mock 3-axis sensors); `setOperationMode(
  DATA_INJECTION)` returns `EX_UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION` otherwise.
* Direct channels are not supported.

## Debugging

Everything of interest is logged with tags starting with `MainlineSensors`:

```
adb logcat -s MainlineSensors MainlineSensorsManager MainlineSensorsLoader \
    MainlineSensorsIio MainlineSensorsInput MainlineSensorsMock \
    MainlineSensorsHwdb MainlineSensorsSettings MainlineSensorsComposite
```

At start-up the HAL logs, for every backend, the discovered devices, their
channels, how each sensor value is derived (scale source, mount matrix source,
proximity near level source, buffer or poll mode) and the final `SensorInfo`
of every exposed sensor. Activation logs show the mode and rate chosen.

## SELinux

The service runs in the platform `hal_sensors_default` domain. The device
policy has to allow, in addition to the platform rules:

* reading `/dev/iio:device*` and reading/writing the IIO sysfs attributes
  (`genfs_contexts` label for `/sys/bus/iio/devices` and
  `/sys/devices/.../iio:device*`),
* writing to `/config/iio/triggers/hrtimer` (configfs) for hrtimer triggers,
* reading `/sys/class/input/*/device/modalias` and `/sys/class/dmi/id/*`,
* reading `vendor.sensors.` properties (define a vendor property type for the
  prefix in `property_contexts`).
