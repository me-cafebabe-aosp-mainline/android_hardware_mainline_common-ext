# DRM framebuffer Composer3 HAL

`drmfb` is a deliberately small Composer3 V5 implementation for systems where
SurfaceFlinger performs all composition. Every application layer is validated
as `Composition.CLIENT`; the HAL imports and scans out only the resulting
client target through DRM KMS.

## Integration

Add `android.hardware.graphics.composer3-service.drmfb_ext` to the product packages
and include its VINTF fragment. By default the service enumerates DRM primary
nodes with libdrm and deterministically prefers a KMS card with a connected
internal display (including virtual-machine connectors), followed by any
connected display and then a headless KMS card. The read-only
`vendor.hwc.drm.device` property can select an explicit
primary-node path and disables automatic selection. The HAL requires DRM master
access and prefers atomic modesetting with a primary plane. Drivers without
atomic KMS use a legacy CRTC/page-flip backend.

The service can be installed directly with
`android.hardware.graphics.composer3-service.drmfb_ext`, or packaged in the vendor
APEX module `com.android.hardware.graphics.composer.drmfb_ext`. APEX products should
set `drmfb_composer.include_init_rc=false` and
`drmfb_composer.include_vintf_fragments=false` so the standalone service does
not install duplicate init or VINTF declarations. The APEX uses the platform
hardware key and certificate, is non-updatable and SoC-specific, and exposes
the canonical runtime APEX name `com.android.hardware.graphics.composer`.
Install only one composer APEX implementation and only one provider of the
`IComposer/default` service in a product.

The paired allocator must expose mapper 4+ standard metadata for DRM fourcc,
modifier, dimensions, and plane layouts. Plane dma-buf FDs are inferred using
the established convention that a zero offset after plane zero starts a new
FD; nonzero offsets share the preceding FD.

Systems whose CPU renderer produces red/blue-swapped client targets can set the
read-only `vendor.hwc.drmfb.swap_rb=true` property. The HAL first tries a paired
opaque DRM FourCC and otherwise applies the correction during CPU staging. Leave
the property disabled for correctly rendered GPU output.

When a primary plane cannot scan out Android's client-target FourCC/modifier,
the HAL converts unprotected, CPU-readable, single-plane 32-bit RGB targets into
double-buffered linear `XRGB8888` dumb framebuffers. This supports the universal
compatibility format exposed by `efidrm`, `ofdrm`, `simpledrm`, and `vesadrm`
without requiring those drivers to scan out `ABGR8888`. Multiplane, YUV, 10-bit,
protected, or otherwise unmappable client targets are not staged.

The `udl` DisplayLink driver supports generic GEM-shmem PRIME imports and
linear `RGB565`/`XRGB8888` scanout. Android client targets use the same
XRGB8888 staging fallback when necessary. Since `udl` transfers only damaged
regions over USB, drmfb forwards validated `ClientTarget.damage` rectangles
through `FB_DAMAGE_CLIPS` when that standard plane property is available.
Empty damage means full-frame damage, while empty rectangles retain the
no-update signal. This also keeps same-buffer content updates visible without
forcing full transfers on other damage-driven DRM drivers. With CPU conversion
disabled, the allocator must provide a directly importable linear RGB565 or
XRGB8888 target. On multi-card systems, set `vendor.hwc.drm.device` to the UDL
primary node when it should be the composer device; this single-card HAL does
not combine displays from multiple DRM cards.

The `gud` Generic USB Display driver has the same compatible GEM-shmem and
damage-driven model. It exposes linear XRGB8888 either natively or through its
kernel conversion path, so drmfb uses direct import when possible and the
existing XRGB8888 staging fallback otherwise. Full-frame damage ensures every
present is transferred over USB, and synthetic vsync covers the absence of a
hardware vblank source. As with UDL, select its primary node explicitly on a
multi-card system when the USB display should own the composer service.

The `hyperv_drm` synthetic display also uses atomic GEM-shmem scanout, exposes
only linear XRGB8888, and updates VRAM from damage clips. drmfb therefore uses
the same XRGB staging, full-frame damage, deferred CRTC activation, and
synthetic-vsync paths. Its fixed virtual connector has no detect callback and
can remain `DRM_MODE_UNKNOWNCONNECTION`; drmfb treats that state as connected
only for `hyperv_drm` when the connector supplies valid modes. Runtime display
power-down remains limited by the kernel driver's lack of an atomic-disable
callback.

The `qxl` driver exposes atomic XRGB8888/ARGB8888 scanout but explicitly returns
`-ENOSYS` for PRIME SG export and import, and its primary plane requires QXL GEM
objects. drmfb therefore always stages client targets into QXL-allocated
XRGB8888 dumb buffers, independent of the general CPU-conversion opt-out. Pair
this path with a CPU-mappable allocator such as `allocator.fb`; minigbm's dumb
backend correctly rejects QXL because gralloc transport requires PRIME export.
QXL performs full primary updates itself and has no hardware-vblank callbacks,
so drmfb's synthetic-vsync fallback remains applicable.

The `bochs-drm` QEMU standard-VGA driver uses atomic GEM-shmem scanout with
linear XRGB8888/BGRX8888, damage clips, and no hardware-vblank callbacks. It is
covered by direct PRIME import or XRGB8888 staging, client-target damage,
deferred CRTC activation, and synthetic vsync. Like Hyper-V, its fixed virtual
connector has no detect callback; drmfb accepts `UNKNOWNCONNECTION` for this
driver only when valid modes are present.

Direct scanout is always preferred over CPU conversion, including compatible
alpha-to-opaque FourCC reinterpretation. Products can set the read-only
`vendor.hwc.drmfb.cpu_conversion=false` property to disable staging entirely;
unsupported client-target formats will then fail instead of consuming CPU time.
The default is true to retain firmware-KMS compatibility. The exception is
`vboxvideo`: it does not provide PRIME import and its primary plane requires
VRAM GEM objects, so the HAL always stages into driver-allocated XRGB8888 dumb
buffers regardless of this property.

Minigbm's generic `staging` backend can provide system-DMA-heap client targets
for other display-only DRM cards by setting
`vendor.minigbm.generic_backend=staging`. If such a card rejects
`PRIME_FD_TO_HANDLE`, drmfb now falls back to its local XRGB8888 dumb staging
path after the failed import. This requires CPU conversion to remain enabled,
unless the driver is one of the mandatory local-staging backends above.

## Behavior

- Physical connectors are ordered internal-first and then by connector ID.
- If no connected panel/internal connector exists, the first connected display
  is reported as internal. Android and HWUI require one internal physical
  display even on desktop and virtual systems whose only output is HDMI, DP, or
  VGA.
- Mode configuration IDs remain stable for the service process lifetime.
- The first callback registration emits a connected event for every display.
- Validation requests CLIENT composition. Atomic displays use `TEST_ONLY`;
  legacy displays verify the mode and framebuffer dimensions.
- Atomic content updates change only primary-plane state and return the
  `OUT_FENCE_PTR` fence. Modeset state is submitted only for power and mode
  changes, avoiding full modesets on ordinary frame updates.
- Client-target damage is bounds-checked and forwarded to `FB_DAMAGE_CLIPS`;
  drivers can retain partial-update optimizations.
- Legacy content updates use `drmModePageFlip` and synchronously wait for its
  exact completion event. Acquire fences are waited in userspace. Completed
  presents return a signaled sync-file fence when DRM syncobjs are available,
  with a waited acquire fence used as a compatibility fallback.
- A constrained non-seamless mode change waits until its requested monotonic
  time before applying the mode; seamless transitions are not supported.
- Mode changes are also accepted as display commands through the
  `DISPLAY_COMMAND_CONFIG_CHANGE` capability. The command is applied before the
  rest of its batch so that validation and presentation observe the new mode,
  and it invalidates the cached client target. A mode change power-cycles the
  display, so a command that requires seamlessness fails unless the requested
  mode is already active.
- `getDisplayKnownVsyncSample` reports a hardware vblank timestamp queried from
  the CRTC, or the last delivered hardware vblank event, paired with the active
  mode period. Displays whose vsync is a software cadence, and drivers without
  vblank support, report `EX_UNSUPPORTED` instead of a synthetic phase. The
  recorded sample is discarded on mode changes and when the display powers
  off.
- OFF disables the CRTC. Atomic and legacy ON transitions defer activation until
  a framebuffer is presented, accommodating drivers that require a primary
  plane whenever a CRTC is active.
- Vsync uses DRM CRTC sequence events and falls back to monotonic timed waits.
- Layer creation and destruction can use Composer3 lifecycle batch commands.
- Fixed-refresh debug callbacks report the active mode period immediately when
  enabled and after mode changes.
- Physical orientation follows the standardized DRM `panel orientation`
  connector property and otherwise defaults to `Transform::NONE`.
- When exactly one real internal DRM display and one Linux backlight device can
  be paired unambiguously, that display advertises
  `DisplayCapability::BRIGHTNESS`. Composer values from 0.0 to 1.0 are scaled
  into `/sys/class/backlight/*/brightness`; negative values also request
  backlight power-down through `bl_power` when available. Brightness updates do
  not require presentation. Board SELinux policy must permit the composer
  domain to access the selected backlight files. The pairing is frozen during
  service initialization so display capabilities do not change on hotplug;
  panels appearing later do not gain brightness support.

## Intentional Scope

Virtual displays, readback/writeback, overlays, sideband streams, HDR and color
processing, content sampling, boot configuration persistence, HDCP, LUTs,
seamless mode changes, idle timers, and low-latency modes are unsupported. No
display capabilities are advertised except brightness when backed by an
unambiguous Linux backlight device. The global
`PRESENT_FENCE_IS_NOT_RELIABLE` capability covers legacy KMS, while atomic KMS
still returns explicit present fences. Layer lifecycle batching and fixed-rate
refresh debug callbacks are advertised together with display-command mode
changes; `SKIP_VALIDATE` is not. NATIVE color mode with COLORIMETRIC intent is
the only color behavior.

Use `dumpsys android.hardware.graphics.composer3.IComposer/default` for the
selected DRM objects, modes, power state, layer counts, target cache state, and
validation state.
