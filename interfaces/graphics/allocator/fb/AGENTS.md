This directory is a self-contained software allocator, Stable-C mapper V5, and
client-composition-only Composer3 V5 stack for legacy fbdev systems.

## Invariants

- Keep the native handle transport-only: two shared-memory FDs and integers,
  with no addresses, mutexes, or other process-local state.
- Keep descriptor acceptance centralized in `BuildLayout`; `isSupported` and
  allocation must agree.
- Reject protected memory. This implementation has no secure heap or scanout.
- Preserve shared mutable metadata and place the client reserved region exactly
  after `SharedMetadata`.
- Use platform standard metadata encoders and decoders.
- Every Composer layer becomes CLIENT. YUV buffers never reach fbdev scanout.
- Preserve command-index errors, transactional lifecycle batches, target slot
  and damage semantics, and the validate/accept/present state machine. Empty
  damage is full-frame; one empty rectangle means no changed pixels.
- Keep per-display layers, targets, slots, power, callbacks, configuration, and
  vsync state isolated. Enumeration is bounded, gap-tolerant, deterministic,
  and deduplicated by device identity; display 0 keeps fb0 preference.
- Wait acquire fences before CPU access. Never manufacture an eventfd fence.
- Keep hardware vsync waits interruptible, cache permanent ioctl limitations,
  keep fallback vsync stoppable, and invoke Binder callbacks without `mutex_`.
- Report a known vsync sample only from a real `FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC` event. Never
  report the synthetic fallback cadence, and discard the recorded sample when
  the display powers off.
- Keep the mapper at Stable-C V5 and report multi-view allocation as
  unsupported. Do not claim IMapper V6 without real view introspection.
- Trust `FBIOGET_VBLANK` fields only when their capability bits are set. The
  generic UAPI has no timestamp field; never interpret its reserved words.
- Do not broaden the red/blue workaround beyond supported RGB conversion.
- Keep fbdev output generic across validated packed true-color bitfields up to
  32 bits; do not silently accept unprogrammable palettes, grayscale, planar,
  or nonstandard memory organizations. DIRECTCOLOR requires saved, bounded
  linear ramps and colormap restoration on device release.
- Mutable C8 uses RGB332. Read-only 8-bit STATIC_PSEUDOCOLOR must query but never
  change its palette and use the precomputed bounded nearest-color lookup.
  Preserve the fbdev `pwrite` damage-notification path because DRM sysfb drivers
  expose deferred shadow mappings rather than direct firmware scanout memory.
- Monochrome output requires explicit MONO01/MONO10 polarity and packed-bit
  ordering. Grayscale is limited to validated packed whole-pixel fields and
  uses luminance conversion; `swap_rb` remains before every output conversion.
- FOURCC requires capability, type, visual, format, zero-bitfield, bpp, stride,
  and little-endian agreement. Keep the whitelist packed RGB-only; reject
  unknown, big-endian, YUV, and planar layouts.
- Report only valid fbdev rotations. Keep config and copy dimensions in fb
  memory coordinates; Composer physical orientation supplies the logical swap,
  so never rotate the copied client target a second time.
- Keep partial conversion and flush bounded to clipped damage, but copy a full
  frame before panning to a backing page whose contents are not synchronized.
- Preserve the last presented frame as owned converted scanout bytes, never as
  a mutable client-buffer reference, and redraw/flush it after unblank.
- Virtual-height expansion may change only `yres_virtual`; re-query fixed and
  variable geometry, validate complete mapping bounds, and restore the original
  mode when a two-page request cannot be used safely.
- Update `README.md` when capabilities, formats, ABI, properties, or packaging
  change.
- Advertise brightness only for the immutable, unambiguous one-display and
  one-backlight pairing. Do not guess mappings on multi-display systems.

The vendor APEX and standalone modules are mutually exclusive. Board SELinux
policy and framebuffer device labels live outside this directory.

## Note about naming convention

This is a component imported from the original repository, and we should avoid
conflicts with the one in the original repository.
