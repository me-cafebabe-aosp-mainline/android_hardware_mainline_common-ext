# fbdev graphics HAL

`fb` is a software-only graphics stack for systems with a legacy Linux fbdev
display and a software renderer such as SwiftShader or llvmpipe. It contains an
allocator AIDL V3 service, a Stable-C mapper V5 SP-HAL, and a Composer3 V5
service. It is not a GPU allocator and does not produce dma-bufs.

## Integration

Install these standalone modules together:

- `android.hardware.graphics.allocator-service.fb_ext`
- `mapper.fb_ext`
- `android.hardware.graphics.composer3-service.fb_ext`

Alternatively install the non-updatable, SoC-specific vendor-bootstrap APEX
`com.android.hardware.graphics.allocator.fb_ext`. For APEX products, set
`fb_graphics.include_init_rc=false` and
`fb_graphics.include_vintf_fragments=false` to avoid duplicate standalone init
and VINTF installation. The APEX uses the platform hardware key and certificate
and contains both services, the mapper, all VINTF fragments, and generated init
scripts. Its linker configuration exposes `mapper.fb_ext` from the APEX namespace
to Stable-C mapper clients. A product must install exactly one
allocator/mapper/composer stack and
must not install both this APEX and another graphics HAL APEX.

SELinux policy outside this directory must allow the allocator to create and
map memfds, SurfaceFlinger and graphics clients to use the mapper SP-HAL, and
the composer domain to open, ioctl, and map the selected framebuffer node.
Device-node labels and allow rules are board-specific and are intentionally not
provided here. The product sepolicy must also map `mapper/fb_ext` to
`u:object_r:hal_graphics_mapper_service:s0` in `service_contexts`.

## Properties

- `vendor.hwc.fbdev.device` is a read-only comma-separated list of explicit
  fbdev paths. Without it the composer scans indices 0 through 31, trying
  `/dev/graphics/fbN` before `/dev/fbN` for each index without stopping at gaps.
  Aliases for the same character device are deduplicated.
- `vendor.hwc.fbdev.swap_rb` is a read-only boolean, default false. It swaps
  source red and blue only in the bounded RGB conversion path.

When exactly one fbdev display and one Linux backlight device exist at service
initialization, the display advertises `DisplayCapability::BRIGHTNESS`.
Normalized values are scaled into `/sys/class/backlight/*/brightness`, while
negative values request backlight power-down through the required `bl_power`
file without overwriting the previous brightness level.
The pairing is immutable and multi-display or multi-backlight systems remain
unsupported rather than risking control of the wrong panel. Board SELinux
policy must allow the composer domain to access these files.

## Buffers

The transport handle has two FDs and fixed-width integer fields only. One memfd
contains linear pixels; the other contains shared standard metadata followed by
the exact requested client reserved region. Process mappings and lock counts are
never serialized. Protected allocations and unknown V2 usage bits or options
are rejected.

Supported formats are RGBA_8888, RGBX_8888, BGRA_8888, RGB_888, RGB_565,
RGBA_FP16, BLOB, RAW16, YV12, NV21/YCRCB_420_SP, planar YCBCR_420_888, P010, and
P210. YUV is linear media/VTS support only; Composer accepts RGB client targets
in the five 8-bit/565 formats and converts them to the fbdev channel layout.
There is no camera-vendor tiling, implementation-defined format selection,
compression, or GPU-private memory.

GPU texture/render usage flags are accepted only to interoperate with software
EGL/Vulkan implementations that consume mapper-locked shared memory. These
allocations do not satisfy a hardware GPU driver's dma-buf or private-memory
requirements. Mapper CPU locks are therefore permitted on these software GPU
buffers even when the original descriptor did not contain CPU usage bits.
Front-buffer allocations are intentionally unsupported.

Mutable dataspace, blend mode, SMPTE2086, and CTA861_3 values are in the shared
metadata memfd and serialized across processes with advisory file locks.
Standard metadata encoding uses the platform mapper helpers. Pixel mappings
support nested locks, explicit flush/reread, and return no fabricated release
fence.

## Composer Scope

The composer exposes each enumerated fbdev node as an internal physical display
with one fixed configuration. Explicit paths retain property order; automatic
enumeration makes the preferred fb0 node display 0. Every layer is validated as
`Composition.CLIENT`; only that display's client target is presented. Devices
have independent layer/target state, power, configuration, damage, and
interruptible vsync workers. The composer supports transactional lifecycle
batch commands, target slots, expected-present timestamps, fixed-refresh debug
callbacks, NATIVE/COLORIMETRIC behavior, client-target damage, display-command
mode changes, and hardware vsync through `FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC`. Unsupported wait
ioctls are cached and use a stoppable synthetic monotonic fallback. After a hardware wait,
`FBIOGET_VBLANK` capability flags and valid retrace counts improve timestamp
sampling and diagnostics. The
generic UAPI has no vblank timestamp field, so reserved fields are ignored and
the callback uses the closest monotonic sample. Empty damage means the full
frame, while one empty rectangle means no changed pixels. Damage is clipped
before bounded conversion and flush.

When the initial mode has only one page, initialization requests two complete
pages by changing only `yres_virtual` through `FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO`. Returned
mode fields, stride, and mapping bounds are revalidated; unsupported or unsafe
expansion retains the original single-page mode. If multiple complete pages are
available, frames are copied to an inactive page and presented with
`FBIOPAN_DISPLAY`. Otherwise Composer copies to the visible page. Acquire fences
are waited for up to three seconds. A waited acquire sync-file is duplicated as
the present fence when available; otherwise no fence is returned under
`PRESENT_FENCE_IS_NOT_RELIABLE`. Eventfds are never exposed as fences.
Switching backing pages still copies the full frame because page contents are
not assumed to be synchronized.

After each successful present, the device owns a byte copy of the converted
visible scanout page rather than retaining a mutable client buffer. A successful
hardware unblank, or re-enabling an emulated blank, redraws and flushes that
last frame. Other backing pages remain unsynchronized and continue to receive a
full copy before panning.

The `DISPLAY_COMMAND_CONFIG_CHANGE` capability is advertised because each
display has exactly one configuration, so selecting it through a display
command is a no-op that always succeeds and is always seamless. Any other
configuration id fails with `EX_BAD_CONFIG`.

`getDisplayKnownVsyncSample` reports the timestamp of the last delivered
`FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC` event together with the current mode period. Displays
served by the synthetic monotonic fallback report `EX_UNSUPPORTED` rather than a
software phase, and the recorded sample is discarded when the display powers
off.

The allocator implements IAllocator V3 but reports every multi-view description
as unsupported and rejects `allocateMultiView` with `AllocationError`
`UNSUPPORTED`. Multi-view handles require view introspection from IMapper V6;
the mapper stays at Stable-C V5, which is also the version the platform mapper
VTS requires.

Virtual displays, readback, overlays, sideband, HDR display output, color
transforms, content sampling, boot config persistence, HDCP, LUTs, seamless
mode changes, multi-view buffers, runtime hotplug discovery, and refresh-rate
switching are unsupported.

Fbdev has no reliable completion fence, and fallback vsync is not hardware phase
locked. Packed true-color fbdev outputs may use arbitrary non-overlapping
RGB and optional alpha bitfields within 1-32 bits per pixel, including RGB565
and XRGB2101010. Direct-color modes are accepted only when their channel lookup
tables have at most 16-bit indices and the existing colormap can be saved before
linear ramps are installed; the saved map is restored when the device closes.
Native mutable C8 pseudocolor requires successful RGB332 colormap programming;
read-only 8-bit `STATIC_PSEUDOCOLOR` queries its 256 entries without modifying
them and uses a precomputed quantized nearest-color lookup for conversion.
Unqueryable palettes are rejected rather than displaying incorrect colors.
MONO01 and MONO10 use luminance thresholding with their declared polarity and
explicit packed-bit ordering. Grayscale output is limited to packed 2, 4, 8, or
16-bit modes whose coincident RGB fields span the complete pixel; conversion
uses integer luminance and honors `msb_right`. FOURCC is accepted only when the
capability, type, visual, zero bitfields, bpp, and stride consistently describe
a single packed V4L2 RGB565, RGB24, XRGB32, ARGB32, XBGR32, ABGR32, or
ARGB2101010 mode. These formats use their UAPI byte layouts on little-endian
hosts; big-endian, unknown, YUV, planar, and other nonstandard modes are
rejected.

Valid `fb_var_screeninfo.rotate` values are reported as the matching Composer
physical orientation. Configuration and client-target dimensions remain the
reported fb memory `xres` and `yres`; quarter-turn logical extents are handled
by the framework orientation, while the fbdev driver performs its declared
scanout rotation. The HAL therefore does not rotate pixels a second time.

DRM fbdev emulation, including `efidrm`, `ofdrm`, `simpledrm`, and `vesadrm`,
maps a shadow framebuffer rather than the firmware aperture. After conversion,
the HAL uses `pwrite` on the fbdev node to trigger immediate damage propagation,
with `msync` as a compatibility fallback. It treats `smem_len == 0` as unknown,
uses the reported line stride, does not depend on physical `smem_start`, and
caches permanent pan/blank limitations. Use the Composer Binder dump for
geometry, channel layout, page, saved-frame, power, target, layer, and
validation state.
